### Assignments


Due by the end of the week (i.e., by the end of Sunday)
- Make your blog post. Comment on 
the work with your team and progress you have made towards your first browser extension (what 
are some problems the group is facing, what good things happened, how do you fit 
into the collaboration, what are your biggest contributions, were there any surprising things you discovered about 
yourself in the process of the group work) 
- Complete the brief quiz on Ed Lessons called _Anatomy of a FOSS project_


Due by February 12
- with your group, continue working on the add-on project
- make sure that the project follows all the best practices of open source
- prepare a 5 minute presentation about your project (to be delivered in front of the class on Feb 12) - you do not need to make slides,
but you need to decide how to organize your presentation and showcase your extension
- One person from each team working on Firefox add-ons should make a post in the
  browser-extension-presentations page on the class wiki. (The other people need to view it and make sure that it is there and that it 
  is properly formatted.)
  The post should follow this format: <br/>
  `Team TeamNumber, [Extension Name](link to the GitHub repo) ` <br/>
  `Team Member 1` <br/>
  `Team Member 2` <br/>
  ...
  (Where the `Team TeamNumber` is the team number you were given during the in-class session.)
  If you are going to use any slides for the presentation on 2/14 then link them here as well.
