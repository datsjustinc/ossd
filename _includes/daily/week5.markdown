### Assignments


Due by the end of the week (i.e., by the end of Sunday)

- Clone the repository called [taking stock](https://github.com/ossd-s25/taking_stock) from the class organization. Use it
to organize your goals and motivations for the open source contributions, your skills and resources that you are bringing
to the table, and your interests that may play a role in your choice of a project and the team that you end you end up working with. This is for your private account and you do not need to submit anything. But you should treat it seriously.

- Read a few project evaluations created by other students. Focus on projects that you are familiar with or that seem to fit your project preferences. 

- Make your blog posts: what are your thoughts about different projects that you have looked at so far? what are you most excited about regarding working on an opens source project? what do you think will be the biggest challenges? how do you plan to overcome them? 

Due by the end of the __next__week (but sooner than later)

- Pick an open source project that you may be interested in contributing to (this should be something that you are excited about, something that you think you may want to be working on, something that matches your goals and skills as you outlined them in the _taking stock_ exercise; it also should NOT be one of the projects assigned in the first part of the project evaluation exercise that you completed with a partner last week). Complete the project evaluation and create a file for that project in the [project evaluation](https://github.com/ossd-s25/project-evaluation) repository.
