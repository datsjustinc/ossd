# Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software

- [Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software](http://www.timreview.ca/article/399) by Chamindra de Silva, Dec. 2010

- __Humanitarian free and open source software (HFOSS)__ represents the application of free
and open source software (FOSS) to the coordination of problems faced in the
humanitarian and disaster-response domains.

  But it is also software related to:

  - Human rights
  - Advocacy
  - Development Cooperation
  - Assistive/Accessible Technologies
  - ...

The cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics provides visualization, analysis and
download of large-scale cancer genomics data sets.

The cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics was originally developed at Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK). The public cBioPortal site is hosted
by the Center for Molecular Oncology at MSK. The cBioPortal software is
now available under an open source license via GitHub. The software is now
developed and maintained by a multi-institutional team, consisting of MSK,
the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto,
Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, The Hyve in the Netherlands, and
Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.

## [Open Energy Dashboard](https://openenergydashboard.github.io/)


.right-column2[

<br><br>
This project, also known as OED, is developing a web-based application to
display energy information that is read and stored from energy meters.
While the project involves a lot of technology, it is ultimately about
sustainability and supporting those goals. The software is free and, as
an open source project, you have access to the code developed and used.
We welcome people becoming involved in the project or using this system
on their own sites. If you want to see an example of a live system it is
available at oed.beloit.edu/demo. Please use the links at the top of the
page to get additional information.

[Dickinson’s College Farm](https://www.dickinson.edu/farm) is a 80-acre, USDA-certified organic
farm and a living laboratory where students can gain distinctive,
hands-on learning experiences.

Web-Based Mobile Database Applications to Support Organic Farming

- __FarmData__: for entering and reporting crop production
records, including seeding, transplanting, harvest, cover
crop, compost, fertilization, irrigation, pest scouting, spray
activities, packing and distribution records and customer
invoicing.
- __AnimalData__: for keeping livestock production records, from
birth to slaughter or sale. Other data captured by the
system includes pasture moves, periodic and veterinary
care and logging of egg production.

## [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

Our mission: to help people learn to code for free.
We accomplish this by creating thousands of videos, articles,
and interactive coding lessons - all freely available to the public.
We also have thousands of freeCodeCamp study groups around the world.

## [Oppia](https://www.oppia.org/splash)

.left-column2[

Oppia's mission is to help anyone learn anything they want in an effective and enjoyable way.

By creating a set of free, high-quality, demonstrably effective lessons with the help of educators from around the world,
Oppia aims to provide students with quality education — regardless of where they are or what traditional resources they have access to.

So far, educators have created more than 11,000 of these lessons, which we call explorations. And they serve almost 430,000 students worldwide.

Explorations help students learn in a fun and creative way, using videos, images, and open-ended questions.
And since students often have similar misconceptions, Oppia also provides educators the ability
to address these misconceptions directly within explorations,
empowering them to provide targeted feedback to multiple students at a time.

NASA has used open source to address project and mission needs, to accelerate software development, and to maximize public awareness and impact of our research. The NASA Open Source Agreement (NOSA) is an Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved license to allow public release of NASA-funded software. Since 2003, we have released more than 60 software projects under the NOSA. Part of NASA’s charter (Space Act of 1958) is to “provide for the widest practical and appropriate dissemination of information concerning its activities and the results thereof.” Open source directly addresses this by facilitating rapid and wide dissemination of software with minimal overhead and cost.
